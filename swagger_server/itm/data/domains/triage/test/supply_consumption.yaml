        Testing consumption of certain supplies after unsuccessful treatments.  Using hemostatic gauze on injuries injuries where
        a tourniquet or pressure bandage is called for consumes the gauze.  Using an airway (on right or left face) always consumes
        a supply, even if there's no injury.

    - { type: Nasopharyngeal airway, quantity: 50 }
    - { type: Hemostatic gauze, quantity: 50 }
