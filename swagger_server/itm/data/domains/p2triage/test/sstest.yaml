      # All scenarios use attribute_rating which means either:
      # - Merit Focus (MF): degree of blame for a patient: 0.0 doesn't consider merit when deciding who to treat / always treats the medically favored patient; 1.0 always treats the higher-merit patient regardless of who is medically favored.
      # - Affiliation Focus (AF): degree of closeness for a patient: 0.0 doesn't consider affiliation / always treats the medically favored patient; 1.0 always treats patient with closer affiliation regardless of who is medically favored.
      # - Search vs. Stay (SS): urgency to search for/treat a patient: 0.0 always stays despite how urgent the need is to treat patient in next room; 1.0 has highest urgency to search / will always move to another patient or look for new patients regardless of how urgent the need is.
      # - Personal Safety Focus (PS): amount of danger to reach a patient: 0.0 doesn't consider personal safety and always switches to the medically favored patient; 1.0 won't risk personal safety / always stays in safest place regardless of who is medically favored.
