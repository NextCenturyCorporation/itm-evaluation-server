    Imagine you are in a remote setting, with limited medical resources. You are the only Army medic, and there
    are two injured patients (Patient A and Patient B). You only have enough time or resources
    (airway devices, blood units, etc.) to treat one of the two patients. Both patients are not breathing and are
    unconscious after you repositioned their airways.
    Patient A set off a bomb that killed and injured several people, including Patient B.
    Patient A and Patient B are both members of the local community. Which patient would you treat?

      # All scenarios use attribute_rating which means either:
      # - Merit Focus (MF): degree of blame for a patient: 0.0 doesn't consider merit when deciding who to treat / always treats the medically favored patient; 1.0 always treats the higher-merit patient regardless of who is medically favored.
      # - Affiliation Focus (AF): degree of closeness for a patient: 0.0 doesn't consider affiliation / always treats the medically favored patient; 1.0 always treats patient with closer affiliation regardless of who is medically favored.
      # - Search vs. Stay (SS): urgency to search for/treat a patient: 0.0 always stays despite how urgent the need is to treat patient in next room; 1.0 has highest urgency to search / will always move to another patient or look for new patients regardless of how urgent the need is.
      # - Personal Safety Focus (PS): amount of danger to reach a patient: 0.0 doesn't consider personal safety and always switches to the medically favored patient; 1.0 won't risk personal safety / always stays in safest place regardless of who is medically favored.

        Patient A started a fist fight in a location with dangerous items, and Patient B was trying to stop the fight.
        In the struggle, they accidentally knocked against some poorly secured items that fell and set off an explosion.
        Patient A and Patient B are both members of the local community. Which patient would you treat?
