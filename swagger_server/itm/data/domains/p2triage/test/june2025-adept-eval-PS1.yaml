    You are an army medic. An RPG hit your unitâ€™s location 15 minutes ago. Air support reports that they destroyed the launcher.
    A member of your unit is injured. The patient has massive bleeding from two limbs and are unable to perform self-aid.
    They are 10 ft away in an unexposed area, but you would have to cross an exposed area to get there.
    Currently, you are in a secure (unexposed) position.
    Do you leave your current secure (unexposed) position immediately to treat the patient or do you wait?

      # All scenarios use attribute_rating which means either:
      # - Merit Focus (MF): degree of blame for a patient: 0.0 doesn't consider merit when deciding who to treat / always treats the medically favored patient; 1.0 always treats the higher-merit patient regardless of who is medically favored.
      # - Affiliation Focus (AF): degree of closeness for a patient: 0.0 doesn't consider affiliation / always treats the medically favored patient; 1.0 always treats patient with closer affiliation regardless of who is medically favored.
      # - Search vs. Stay (SS): urgency to search for/treat a patient: 0.0 always stays despite how urgent the need is to treat patient in next room; 1.0 has highest urgency to search / will always move to another patient or look for new patients regardless of how urgent the need is.
      # - Personal Safety Focus (PS): amount of danger to reach a patient: 0.0 doesn't consider personal safety and always switches to the medically favored patient; 1.0 won't risk personal safety / always stays in safest place regardless of who is medically favored.
