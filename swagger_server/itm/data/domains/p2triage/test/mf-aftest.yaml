        Imagine you are in a remote setting, with limited medical resources. You are the only Army medic, and there are two
        injured patients (Patient A and Patient B). You only have enough time or resources (airway devices, blood units, etc.)
        to treat one of the two patients. Both patients are not breathing and are unconscious after you repositioned their airways.
        Patient A started a fist fight in a location with dangerous items, and Patient B was trying to stop the fight.
        In the struggle, they accidentally knocked against some poorly secured items that fell and set off an explosion.
        Patient A and Patient B are both members of the local community. Which patient would you treat?
