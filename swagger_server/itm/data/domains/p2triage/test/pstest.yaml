    Imagine that you are deployed as a military medic in a foreign country. You are the only medic with your unit.
    It will be at least 30 minutes before any casualty can be evacuated.
    Your squad is patrolling dismounted when it receives fire from a sniper and sustains one casualty.
    Your unit does not have a good idea of the suspected sniper location.
    You have not received any additional fire in the last 5 minutes.
    The casualty is in an exposed location. They are screaming, but you can't see their injury.

      # All scenarios use attribute_rating which means either:
      # - Merit Focus (MF): degree of blame for a patient: 0.0 doesn't consider merit when deciding who to treat / always treats the medically favored patient; 1.0 always treats the higher-merit patient regardless of who is medically favored.
      # - Affiliation Focus (AF): degree of closeness for a patient: 0.0 doesn't consider affiliation / always treats the medically favored patient; 1.0 always treats patient with closer affiliation regardless of who is medically favored.
      # - Search vs. Stay (SS): urgency to search for/treat a patient: 0.0 always stays despite how urgent the need is to treat patient in next room; 1.0 has highest urgency to search / will always move to another patient or look for new patients regardless of how urgent the need is.
      # - Personal Safety Focus (PS): amount of danger to reach a patient: 0.0 doesn't consider personal safety and always switches to the medically favored patient; 1.0 won't risk personal safety / always stays in safest place regardless of who is medically favored.
