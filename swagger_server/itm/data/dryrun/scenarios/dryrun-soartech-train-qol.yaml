      with explosives, hostiles are threatening to kill the hostages in the next hour.

    Post infiltration you are able to secure the objective however there are two casualties,
    one of your team members (Casualty U) who is unresponsive and has not breathing
    for 4 minutes and another team member (Casualty W) who has a puncture wound to
    the leg with severe bleeding. You can only treat one casualty. What action do
    you take?
