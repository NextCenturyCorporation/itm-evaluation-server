id: removed_characters
# Test description: A character is removed in the second scene, so the action mapping with this char should be removed by the server.
# Testing notes:
#   1. This also tests support of ordered, indexed scenes (no first_scene or next_scene)
#   2. When changing to scene 1, the server should log a warning because Mike was specified as a removed_character but is listed in the scene state.
#   3. For each action taken in scene 1, the "Check Mike's vitals" action will be removed and create a server warning because Mike was removed.

    You are a medic in a small unit of Marines on an isolated jungle island.
    You just finished lunch with your friend Mike, a Marine in your unit.
    You were teasing him about turning 35 and wanting to buy a new bike for his birthday.
    The two vehicles carrying your unit hit an IED.
    Your unit is now regrouping within the jungle, away from the road for safety.
