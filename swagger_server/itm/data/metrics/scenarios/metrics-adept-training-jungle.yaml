name: Military Base Fire
state:
  unstructured: >
    You are a military care provider who is woken up at night by a fire alarm on base.
    When you go outside, you see that the fire alarm was real and that there are casualties.
    Among the injured are two soldiers who are heavily intoxicated.
    You learn that the fire was likely caused by cigarettes they discarded carelessly in their barracks.
    They have smoke inhalation injuries which could be fatal if untreated, but if they receive a simple treatment promptly they are likely to survive.
    Also among the injured is a soldier from a building next door to where the fire began.
    She has severe burns over most of her body, as well as smoke inhalation injuries, and will require more complex immediate treatment to have even a small chance of recovery.
    Providing the more complex treatment for her would mean ignoring the othersâ€™ injuries, making it more likely that they will die.
