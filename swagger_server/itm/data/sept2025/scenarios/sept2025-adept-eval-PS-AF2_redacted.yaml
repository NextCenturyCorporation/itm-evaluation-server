  state:
    unstructured: 'Your unit is conducting a mounted patrol on JLTVs when you are
      ambushed, receiving small arms and RPG fire, and sustaining one casualty. Your
      unit returns fire at the suspected enemy location. About six enemy troops are
      spotted withdrawing. You have not received any additional fire in the last 3
      minutes.

      The casualty is in a location with cover, but you would need to move across
      20 ft of exposed area to reach them. They are not visible from your location,
      but you are told they aren''t breathing. They are a US warfighter from a different
      branch of the military than you.

      You are currently in a location with cover. Do you move to treat the casualty
      now, or wait in your current location?'
