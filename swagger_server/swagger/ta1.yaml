  title: ITM MVP TA3 API
  description: |-
    This is the specification of a proposed TA3 API for the In The Moment (ITM) Minimum Viable Product (MVP).  Currently, there is an Evaluation API for TA2 and a preliminary scenario/probe submission API for TA1 that won't be used in the MVP, and currently lacks an API regarding sending probe responses and receiving alignment scores from TA1.

    The API is based on the OpenAPI 3.0 specification.

    Some aspects of this API are not necessarily planned to be implemented for MVP, but show the direction we are heading.
