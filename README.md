# In the Moment (ITM) - TA3 Server

This README provides a guide to set up and run the TA3 ITM server application.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Setup

1. First, we need to setup a Python virtual environment. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and run the following command to create a new virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the newly created virtual environment with:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows, the method to activate depends on the shell:
- Git Bash: `source venv/Scripts/activate`
- PowerShell: `venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
- cmd.exe: `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python -m swagger_server
```

You can browse the API at:

```
http://localhost:8080/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t swagger_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 swagger_server
```
